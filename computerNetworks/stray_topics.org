* Transmission delay
\[ T_t = \frac{D}{B} \]
\[ \text{$D$ = Data size to transmit} \]
\[ \text{$B$ = Bandwidth of link} \]
* Propogation delay
\[ T_p = \frac{d}{s} \]
\[ \text{$d$ = distance of link} \]
\[ \text{$s$ = wave propogation speed} \]
* Total time for a cycle (frame transmission and it's acknowledgement)
\[ \text{Total cycle time of Stop and Wait ARQ} = T_t(data) + T_p(data) + T_t(acknowledgement) + T_p(acknowledgement) \]
/Since acknowledgement are very small in size, their transmission delay is neglected/
\[ \text{Total cycle time of Stop and Wait ARQ} = T_t + 2 T_p \]
* Effictive bandwidth / Throughput
Actual bits sent per second (actual as in data bits, not considering acknowledgments and headers)
\[ Throughput = \frac{D}{\text{Total cycle time}} \]
Here $D$ is data size
\[ Throughtput = Efficiency \times Bandwidth \]
Bandwidth of the channel and effective bandwidth relation
* Capacity of link
In data link layer, capacity of link is the maximum possible number of bits in the link
\[ Capacity = Bandwidth \times T_p\]
For full duplex
\[ Capacity = 2 \times Bandwidth \times T_p \]
